ASP.NET Core Web App with Custom B2C Policy

This web app is a very simple ASP.NET Core application that demonstrates how to add an Azure B2C Custom Policy to an existing application that already uses the Microsoft.Identity.Web library to handle built-in B2C User Flows.

The differences that make the Extra Custom Policy work are found in the following files:
 - AppSettings.json
 - Startup.cs
 - HomeController.cs
 - _partialLayout.xml
